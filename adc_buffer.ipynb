    "# Design a circuit for IoT4Ag LoRaWAN buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "Designed by: Edinson F. Adarme\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewed by: Fabio A. Castiblanco - Andrew D. Balmos\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operational amplifier (OpAmp) for instrumentation\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the AD8266 because of its high precision, high performance, wide voltage range, low power consumption, and overload protection, making it suitable for our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equations that govern the AD8266\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the equations that determine the behavior of the OpAmp.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output voltage\n",
    "$V_{out} = G*(V_{in+}-V_{in-}) + V_{ref}$  $(1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gain of OpAmp\n",
    "$G = 1 + \\frac{49.4 k\\Omega}{R_G}$       $(2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "*These equations are taken from the [datasheet.](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD8226.pdf)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protections\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, following the manufacturer's recommendations, power supply protections are implemented. For this purpose, two capacitors are connected in parallel to the $Vs_+$ input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values are $10\\mu F$ and $0.1\\mu F$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the manufacturer's recommendations, protections are implemented to protect the ADC from large voltages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [AD8615](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD8615_8616_8618.pdf) OpAmp, a $10nF$ capacitor, and two resistors, one with a value of $10k \\Omega$ and the other of $10 \\Omega$, were used. \n",
    "\n",
    "The AD8266 is an operational amplifier used as a buffer, and the AD8616 is used to scale the output between 0 and 3.3V. Then, to safeguard the integrated circuit against electrostatic discharges, TVS (Transient Voltage Suppressor) components were employed, which consist of two Zener diodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoRaWAN module and battery are placed in a single box together with the PCB. For this, the [*WC-39 Outdoor Enclosure with Clear Cover*](https://www.polycase.com/wc-39) will be used, which has the following dimensions:\n",

    "\n",
    "The following step is to calculate the value of the gain resistor among other things. For that, we will use equation 2."
